# Script Stash

## What's Inside?
Hey there! Welcome to my "Script Stash" â€“ A private GitHub repo for all sorts of handy scripts. We've got shell scripts for playing with images, organizing files in bulk , and even some Windows scripts for those mundane yet pesky everyday admin tasks.

## How to Use
Each script comes with its own set of easy-to-follow instructions. Dive in, make these scripts your own, and let me know if you've got ideas to make them even better.
