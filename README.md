# Script Stash

## What's Inside?
Hey there! Welcome to my "Script Stash" â€“ A private GitHub repo for all sorts of handy scripts. We've got shell scripts for playing with images, organizing files in bulk , and even some Windows scripts for those mundane yet pesky everyday admin tasks.

## How to Use
Each script comes with its own set of easy-to-follow instructions. Dive in, make these scripts your own, and let me know if you've got ideas to make them even better.

## Dependencies

Here's a list of dependencies/packages required to run the scripts along with brief explanations:

#### Linux (Debian-based)
- **zip**: A compression and file packaging utility. Used for compressing files and creating archives.
- **gzip**: A file compression utility. Used for compressing files into the gzip format.
- **tar**: A utility for packaging files into a single archive file. Commonly used with gzip for compression.
- **python3**: The Python 3 interpreter. Required for executing Python scripts.
- **imagemagick**: A software suite for displaying, converting, and editing raster image files. Used for image manipulation tasks.
- **rename**: A command-line utility for renaming multiple files at once.

```bash
sudo apt-get install zip gzip tar python3 imagemagick rename
```

#### Windows

- **7zip**: A file archiver utility with a high compression ratio. Used for compressing and decompressing files.
- **python3**: The Python 3 interpreter. Required for executing Python scripts.
- **imagemagick**: A software suite for displaying, converting, and editing raster image files. Used for image manipulation tasks.
